In this doubt portion i will clear your any doubt about how the [Lcm](Lcm.java) and [Gcd](Gcd.java) code is written and for that i will demonstrate an example as well

The [GCD](Gcd.java) ([LCM](Lcm.java)) of more than two numbers can also be found easily. For this, first compute the [GCD](Gcd.java) ([LCM](Lcm.java)) of the first two numbers. Suppose, the result comes to be a1. Then, compute the [GCD](Gcd.java) ([LCM](Lcm.java)) of a1 and the third number. This process may be repeated till all the numbers are exhausted. Finally, the desired [GCD](Gcd.java) ([LCM](Lcm.java)) will be obtained.

Example:- Find the [GCD](Gcd.java), and [LCM](Lcm.java) of 12, 27 and 9.
Solution:- 
First, we find the [GCD](Gcd.java) of 12 and 27 as follows:
[GCD](Gcd.java)(12, 27) = GCD(27, 12)
            = GCD(12, 3)
            = GCD(3, 0)
            = 3

Then, we find the [GCD](Gcd.java) of 3 and 9 as follows:
[GCD](Gcd.java)(3, 9) = GCD(9, 3)
          = GCD(3, 0)
          = 3

Now, let us find the [LCM](Lcm.java) of the above three numbers. First, we find the LCM of 12 and 27 as follows:
[LCM](Lcm.java)(12, 27) = 12*27/GCD(12, 27)
            = 12*27/3
            = 108

Then, we find the [LCM](Lcm.java) of 108 and 9 as follows:
[LCM](Lcm.java)(108, 9) = 108*9/GCD(108, 9)
            = 108*9/GCD(9, 0)
            = 108*9/9
            = 108

So, [GCD](Gcd.java) and [LCM](Lcm.java) of 12, 27 and 9 are 3 and 108 respectively.
The readers can write programs to find the GCD and LCM of more than two numbers, themselves.
